'No Low Quality Leaks': {'title': 'Leak', 'message': 'There are two reasons for a leak to be remove:\n\n1) This post has been removed as it does not meet our standards for a "leak." We require at least some shred of evidence for a leak to be considered legit. Just having an image of names of characters on an image does not qualify as a proper leak. In fact, we have seen people post fake leaks before. And occasionally, these leaks never even come through. It is for these reasons that we require more proof before allowing a leak.\n\n2) Leaks which are covered in Water Marks that obscure the subject of the image will be removed.\n\nYour post violates one of those two conditions and has been removed. Thanks for your understanding.\n\n***\nThis comment was left automatically and as a courtesy to you. If you have any questions, please reply to this message.'},
'Tracking Post must include location or online link': {'title': 'Tracking', 'message': 'This post was removed because tracking Posts require Location(State & City).
